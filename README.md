<b>Challenges faced:</b>
<ul>
<li>Collecting meaningful data: With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most.</li>
<li> Unknown Values: Dealing with the unknown values in the data is a task in itself to analyze in the best way. </li>
<li> Visual representation of data: To understand data it often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. It’s difficult to build them manually.
  Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas is a time consuming. </li>
  </ul></p>
 <b>Conclusions:</b>
  <ol>
<li>Maximum number of attacks are 16903 across the world in the year 2014.</li> 
<li>Taliban group has executed the maximum number of attacks i.e 7360 in the last two decades.</li> 
<li>Asia is the most affected region by terrorist attacks with Iraq having maximum number of attacks.</li>

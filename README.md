<b>Conclusions</b>
<b>Challenges faced:</b>
<p>
Collecting meaningful data: With so much data available, it’s difficult to dig down and access the insights that are needed most.
Unknown Values: Dealing with the unknown values in the data is a task in itself to analyze in the best way. 
Visual representation of data: To understand data it often needs to be visually presented in graphs or charts. It’s difficult to build them manually. Taking the time to pull information from multiple areas is a time consuming. 
Collate the work: Integrating everyone’s work into a single space took us a little more time than expected in a very well understandable way
